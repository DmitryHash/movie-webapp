<h1>Project Name: Clone Pixema</h1>

Welcome to my first project, "Clone Pixema"! In this project, I aimed to replicate the functionality of Pixema using React, with the assistance of online resources. I utilized various technologies such as React, Redux, TypeScript, Axios, and the Material-UI (MUI) library.

<h2>Project Overview</h2>

The main objective of this project was to develop a movie search and rendering application. The implemented features include searching for movies, fetching data from a backend server, filtering results, and displaying movie details.

<h2>Getting Started</h2>

To run the project locally, follow the steps below:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Open your preferred code editor and navigate to the project directory.
3. Open the terminal within the code editor.
4. Run the command npm install to install all the required dependencies.
5. Wait for the installation process to complete.
6. (Optional) Restart the code editor to avoid any potential errors.
7. Open the terminal again (if you restarted the code editor).
8. Run the command npm start to start the application.

The above steps will set up the project and launch it in your default browser.
