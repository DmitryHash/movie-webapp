Hi and welcome to my first project named "clone Pixema"
In this project, I tried to do everything that I understood in the React classes, not without the help of the Internet, of course.
The project uses a third-party MUI library (this is also my first experience with this library), as well as Redux, SCSS, TypeScript, React, Axios. The project implements the functionality of searching, getting from BackEnd, filtering and rendering movies.
To start my project, you will need:
1. Clone my repository to yourself.
2. In the code editor, open the terminal and write
"npm install".
3. Wait until all the necessary library files are downloaded and installed.
4. Restart the code editor (not necessary, but desirable, in order to avoid incomprehensible errors)
5. Open the terminal again(if you restart code editor) and write "npm start".
